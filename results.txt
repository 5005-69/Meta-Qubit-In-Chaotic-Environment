## Experiment: STEPS = 300 (.\images\STEPS = 300)

In this section, we analyze the simulation outputs when running **300 steps** on a complete network of 100 nodes (50 repetitions) using a 12-qubit MetaQubit. The following figures illustrate the cost function evolution, the standard deviation of edge weights, and the distribution of weights at specific simulation steps.

1. **Cost Convergence Over Simulation Steps**  
   - The cost function fluctuates around a value close to zero, with relatively large variations (as indicated by the shaded standard deviation).  
   - This reflects the stochastic nature of the MetaQubit output: it does not lock into a single state but continues exploring positive/negative values throughout the simulation.

2. **Convergence of Edge Weights Variance**  
   - The average standard deviation of edge weights gradually increases from about 0.283 to around 0.288 by step 300.  
   - This indicates a self-organizing trend: while most edges remain near zero, a few edges acquire higher or lower values, causing a slight overall rise in variance.

3. **Histograms of Edge Weights**  
   - **Step 0:** The initial distribution is nearly uniform in the range [-1, 1].  
   - **Step 150:** Most edge weights cluster near zero, yet a few edges exhibit values up to ±25 or beyond.  
   - **Step 299:** Even more extreme outliers appear (±50, ±100, etc.), but the bulk of edges is still concentrated near zero. This explains why the standard deviation increases only modestly rather than exploding.

**Summary for STEPS = 300**  
Overall, the network shows a mild yet consistent increase in weight variance over 300 steps, with the cost function oscillating around zero. The majority of edges remain close to zero, whereas a small subset of edges develops large positive or negative weights, driving the observed variance upwards.


## Experiment: STEPS = 600 (.\images\STEPS = 600)

When running **600 steps**, the edge weight variance continues to rise gradually, while the cost function remains noisy around zero. Key observations include:

1. **Cost Convergence Over Simulation Steps**  
   - The mean cost hovers near zero with a relatively large standard deviation (about 0.1).  
   - This reflects the ongoing stochastic behavior of the MetaQubit, which does not settle into a single mode but explores both positive and negative outputs.

2. **Convergence of Edge Weights Variance**  
   - The mean standard deviation of edge weights increases from roughly 0.283 to around 0.292 by step 600.  
   - This mostly monotonic rise indicates that while most edges remain close to zero, a few edges develop significantly large positive or negative values, pushing the overall variance upward.

3. **Histograms of Edge Weights**  
   - **Step 0:** A nearly uniform distribution within the range [-1, 1].  
   - **Step 300:** Outliers appear up to about ±200, but the majority of weights are clustered near zero.  
   - **Step 599:** Extreme values reach ±400 for a small number of edges, whereas the main body of the distribution still centers around zero.  
   - These outliers explain the steady increase in the overall standard deviation without causing an explosive divergence.

**Summary for STEPS = 600**  
Overall, the network continues to exhibit a slow yet consistent growth in variance, while the cost remains stochastic around zero. This behavior indicates that the MetaQubit-driven updates keep exploring the weight space, fostering a self-organizing dynamic in the network.

## Experiment: STEPS = 1000 (.\images\STEPS = 1000)

When running **1000 steps**, the network continues to show a gradual increase in edge weight variance, with the cost function fluctuating around zero. Key observations include:

1. **Cost Convergence Over Simulation Steps**  
   - The cost remains near zero, with a relatively high standard deviation (~0.1–0.12).  
   - This indicates that the MetaQubit persists in generating stochastic outputs, never locking into a single, stable value.

2. **Convergence of Edge Weights Variance**  
   - The mean standard deviation of edge weights rises from about 0.282 to approximately 0.294 by step 1000.  
   - The increase is largely monotonic, suggesting that while most edges stay near zero, a few edges develop significantly large positive or negative values, pushing the overall variance higher.

3. **Histograms of Edge Weights**  
   - **Step 0:** Almost uniform distribution within [-1, 1].  
   - **Step 500:** Outliers up to ±300 appear, yet the majority of weights remain clustered around zero.  
   - **Step 999:** Even more extreme outliers (±400, ±600) are visible for a handful of edges, but the bulk of the distribution is still centered near zero.  
   - These sparse but large outliers explain the slow, steady increase in the overall standard deviation.

**Summary for STEPS = 1000**  
Overall, the network exhibits a consistently rising variance without devolving into chaotic or explosive growth. The cost function continues oscillating around zero, demonstrating that the MetaQubit-driven updates maintain a stochastic exploration of the weight space over the long run.


## Conclusion

These experiments demonstrate a stable, non-linear dynamic imposed on a 100-node network by only **12 MetaQubits**. Despite the network’s large size (nearly 5,000 edges), the results show that the MetaQubit:

- **Produces more than mere random noise:** There is a clear trend in the rising standard deviation of edge weights and distinct patterns in the cost function.
- **Achieves self-organizing behavior:** Most edges remain clustered around zero, while a small subset evolves into extreme positive or negative values, creating a “spread out” distribution that remains stochastically stable.
- **Maintains cost balance (~0):** The cost oscillates without diverging or collapsing, suggesting continuous exploration of positive and negative outputs.

Overall, using 12 MetaQubits to “coordinate” a much larger network validates the **quantum-inspired** approach:

- A **small parameter set** (qubits)  
- **Large-scale** network handling (100 nodes)  
- **Non-linear, self-organized** evolution without exponential resource requirements  

These findings pave the way for further research with alternative graph topologies (beyond complete graphs), different cost metrics, and even larger scales—where MetaQubits can serve as an **efficient, quantum-inspired method** for self-organization and optimization.
